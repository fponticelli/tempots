# Installation

Tempo is available as a package on npm. You can install it using npm or yarn:

```bash
# npm
npm install @tempots/dom

# yarn
yarn add @tempots/dom
```

Tempo is written in TypeScript so types are generated and included in the package. You can use Tempo with or without TypeScript. If you are using TypeScript, you will get full type checking and autocompletion.

`@tempots/dom` doesn't have any dependency. If you use `@tempots/ui` you will also need to install `@tempots/dom` and `@tempots/std` as they are peer dependencies.
