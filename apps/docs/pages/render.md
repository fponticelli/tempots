# Render

Rendering is the final act of applying `Renderable`s to the DOM. When defining renderables, nothing in the DOM is changed or updated, not until those renderables are applied using either `render()` or `renderWithContext()`. Both functions return a `cancel` function that can be used to undo the modifications described in the applied renderables.

## render()

A rendering function that takes two mandatory arguments, a `Renderable` that describes the change to apply to the DOM and a parent node (either as an instance or as a CSS selector) where to apply those changes.

Optionally you can pass an object with the following options:

* a `document` instance to be used during the rendering. This is only necessary in special context, like rendering in a non-browser context when using a string selector for `parent`.
* the `clear` option indicates if the rendering operation should also remove the contents that were potentially generated by the SSR component.

```ts
function render(
  node: Renderable,
  parent: Node | string,
  { doc, clear }: { doc?: Document; clear?: boolean } = {}
): () => void
```

## renderWithContext()

`renderWithContext()` is a more atomic operation that requires an already instantiated `DOMContext`. Like `render` it returns a `cancel` function.

```ts
function renderWithContext(node: Renderable, ctx: DOMContext): () =&gt; void
```
