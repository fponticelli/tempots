# Renderables

Renderables or components are the building blocks of Tempo applications. They are the templates that are rendered to the DOM. Tempo provides a set of functions to create and manipulate renderables.

The Renderable functions use the convention of starting with a capital letter. This is to differentiate them from regular functions and to make it easier to identify them in the code. The notable exception is for basic html/svg elements, which are lowercase.

## HTML/SVG, text and Attributes

To create HTML or SVG elements, use the `html` and `svg` objects. Each of them contains the full list of available tags as functions. For example, to create a `div` element, use `html.div()`. To create a `circle` element, use `svg.circle()`.

These functions take an arbitrary number of `TNode` arguments. A `TNode` can be a string, a `Signal&lt;string&gt;`, a `Renderable`, a `Renderable[]` or `null`/`undefined`.

To create text nodes, you can just pass a `string` or a `Signal&lt;string&gt;` where a `TNode` is expected. Alternatively you can be explicit and use the `TextNode()` function.

```ts
const titleSignal = signal('Hello, World!')

html.div(
  'Hello, World!', // <-- this is a text node
  titleSignal, // <-- this is a signal that automatically updates a text node
  html.span('This is a span'),
  TextNode('This is also a text node')
)
```

To create DOM attributes and properties use the `attr` object. It contains functions for all the standard attributes and properties. For example, to set the `id` attribute, use `attr.id('my-id')`.

```ts
html.image(
  attr.id('my-id'),
  attr.src('https://example.com/image.jpg'),
  attr.title(titleSignal)
)
```

You will have noticed that text nodes and attribute values accept both literal values (ex. `'Hello, World!'`) and signals (ex. `titleSignal`). This is because the arguments are types as `Value<T>` which is a union of `T` and `Signal<T>`. `Value<string>` also happens to be part of the `TNode` union.

### attr.class

The class attribute is special in the sense that can be used multiple times in the same element.

```ts
const classSignal = signal('class3 class4')
html.div(
  attr.class('class1 class2'),
  attr.class(classSignal)
)
```

A class attribute can be a string or a signal that emits a string. The string can contain multiple classes separated by spaces.

### Other attributes and elements

There are helper objects to create arbitrary data-attributes, math/svg elements and attributes, and style attributes.

```ts
html.div(
  dataAttr.mydata('myvalue'),
  math.math(
    mathAttr.display('inline'),
    math.mfrac(
      math.msup(
        math.mi('Ï€'),
        math.mn('2'),
      ),
      math.mn('6'),
    ),
  ),
  svg.svg(
    svg.circle(svgAttr.cx(50), svgAttr.cy(50), svgAttr.r(40)),
  ),
  style.color('red')
)
```

## Events

Similar to attributes, events can be set using the `on` object. The `on` object contains functions for all the standard events. For example, to set the `click` event, use `on.click(fn)`.

It is fine to use `signal.value` or `signal.get()` to get the value of a signal in an event handler.

### emit

Tempo provides a set of functions to simplify event handling. For example `emitValue` emits the value of the current `input` element when the event is triggered.

## input elements

When using `input` elements it is very common you want to specify the type of the input. Tempo provides a set of functions to create `input` elements with the correct type. For example, to create a `number` input, use `input.number()`.

## bind

Tempo provides functions to bind `Props` to input elements. For example, to bind a `string` prop to an `input` element, use `bindText`. This sets a bidirectional binding between the prop and the input element.

## Conditionals

Tempo has a set of functions to create conditional renderables. For example, to render a `div` element only if a condition is met, use `When` (or `Unless` for its negation).

```ts
const showSignal = makeSignal(true)

When(showSignal,
  html.div('This is visible')
)
```

A second argument can be passed to `When` to specify a renderable to show when the condition is false.

An interesting aspect of conditionals in Tempo, is that there is no DOM rebuilding unless the branch is changed.

### Ensure

In TypeScript it is common to work with values that can be `null` or `undefined`. To render a value only if it is not `null` or `undefined`, use `Ensure`.

```ts
const valueSignal = makeSignal<string | null>('Hello, World!')

Ensure(
  valueSignal,
  v => html.div(v.map(text => `This is visible: ${text}`))
)
```

Unlike `When`, `Ensure` takes a function that returns a renderable. This function is called with a new signal that is guaranteed to be not `null` or `undefined`.

### OneOf

For more complicated pattern matching you can use one of the `OneOf` renderables. You generally match on the value of an object field. For that you can use `OneOfField`, `OneOfKind`, or `OneOfType`.

```ts
type MyType = { kind: 'A', text: string } | { kind: 'B', value: number }

const valueSignal = makeSignal<MyType>({ kind: 'A', text: 'Hello, World!' })

OneOfKind(valueSignal, {
  A: v => html.div('A: ', v.$.text),
  B: v => html.div('B: ', v.$.value.map(String))
})
```

## Loops

Of course you can also render lists of elements. Tempo provides a set of functions to create loops. For example, to render a list of `div` elements, use `ForEach`.

```ts
const itemsSignal = makeSignal(['Item 1', 'Item 2', 'Item 3'])

ForEach(
  itemsSignal,
  (item, position) => html.div(
    position.$.counter.map(String),
    ': ',
    item
  )
)
```

The renderable function takes two arguments. The first is a signal that represent an element of the list. The second is a signal that represents the position of the element in the list. The position signal has a `counter` field that is the 1-based index of the element in the list as well as a `isFirst`, `isLast` and `index`.

`ForEach` accepts an optional third argument to render a separator between elements.

You can wrap your loop in a `NotEmpty` renderable if you want to ensure that the list is not empty. This is useful in the case of structures like `UL` or `OL` where an empty list would not be desired.

```ts
const itemsSignal = makeSignal(['Item 1', 'Item 2', 'Item 3'])

NotEmpty(
  itemsSignal,
  html.ul(
    ForEach(
      items,
      item => html.li(item),
      html.br()
    ),
  ),
  'No items'
)
```
